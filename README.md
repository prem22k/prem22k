## 👋 About Me

I’m a B.Tech undergraduate at SNIST focused on **building production-ready web applications**, not just demos.

I enjoy taking real problems — event coordination, communication, file handling, automation — and turning them into **usable software** with clean UI, reliable backend systems, and solid deployment.

## 🚀 Flagship Project

### **ToolDeck** — All-in-One Productivity Suite
