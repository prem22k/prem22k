## About Me



I’m a software engineer focused on system architecture, backend reliability, and end-to-end product ownership.



I build platforms that require real-time synchronization, secure data handling, and resilient communication pipelines. My approach prioritizes maintainability, deterministic logic, and failure-aware system design over temporary demos.

# Core Projects



## Zync — Real-Time Collaboration Platform  

**Status:** Active Development (Web + Desktop)  

**Focus:** Hybrid database design, WebSockets, secure GitHub integration  



🔗 **Repo:** https://github.com/prem22k/Zync

🔗 **Live:** https://zync-meet.vercel.app/



A unified workspace combining task management, structured workflows, and persistent communication.



**Engineering Highlights**

- Webhook engine verifies GitHub commits using HMAC SHA-256 before updating task states

- Hybrid data model: Firestore for high-frequency chat writes, MongoDB for structured metadata

- Designed to maintain consistency between code activity and project workflow states

## QuizWhiz — Real-Time Multiplayer Quiz Platform  

**Status:** Functional  

**Focus:** Serverless scoring logic, real-time state sync  



🔗 **Repo:** https://github.com/prem22k/QuizWhiz 

🔗 **Live:** https://quizwhiz-live.vercel.app/



Interactive quiz system built for live events and learning environments.



**Engineering Highlights**

- Scoring logic secured via Firebase Cloud Functions

- Firestore snapshot listeners for low-latency synchronization

- Designed to prevent client-side manipulation



---



## AI GitHub Auditor  

**Status:** Functional  

**Focus:** Deterministic heuristics + LLM-assisted analysis  



🔗 **Repo:** https://github.com/prem22k/ai-github-auditor

🔗 **Live:** https://ai-github-auditor.vercel.app/



Automated repository evaluation tool combining rule-based analysis with language models.



**Engineering Highlights**

- Applies deterministic repository heuristics before LLM scoring

- Separates structured signals from generative reasoning

- Designed to reduce false positives in technical evaluations



---



## Cloud Community Club Platform  

**Status:** Production (1,000+ users)  

**Focus:** Workflow automation, resilient communication  



🔗 **Repo (Frontend):** https://github.com/prem22k/snist-website-fn 

🔗 **Repo (Backend):** https://github.com/prem22k/snist-website-bn 

🔗 **Live:** https://cloudcommunityclub-c3.vercel.app/



Centralized membership and resource platform for a student technology community.



**Engineering Highlights**

- Structured membership intake and automated notifications

- SMTP fallback strategy for reliable email delivery

- Actively maintained and used in production

# How I Work



- Design systems with failure scenarios in mind  

- Separate deterministic logic from AI reasoning  

- Prefer measurable behavior over assumptions  

- Build iteratively and refactor aggressively  



---



# Technical Stack



**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, C++  



**Frontend:** React, Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Vite  



**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions), MongoDB  



**Infrastructure:** Docker, Vercel, Render, GitHub Actions
